# Hashing pattern - made an empty hash Table (empty dict) and iterate through the array and get the difference by subtracting target - element if the diff in hash Table return the index the difference is in, otherwise keep appending the element as key and and index of it as value.


# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,2]
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
# Output: [0,1]

# ðŸ”¹ Sliding Window

# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

# Sliding Window- to calculate the length of window the formula always gonna be W = (R-L)+1, This question is the Variable length version example


# class Solution(object):
#     def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
#         """
#         :type s: str
#         :rtype: int
#         """
#         l = 0
#         longest = 0
#         sett = set()
#         n = len(s)
#         for i in range(n):
#             while s[i] in sett:
#                 sett.remove(s[l])
#                 l += 1
#             w = (i - l) + 1
#             longest = max(w, longest)
#             sett.add(s[i])
#         return longest

    # Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

    # Example 1:

    # Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    # Output: 3
    # Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
    # Example 2:

    # Input: s = "bbbbb"
    # Output: 1
    # Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
    # Example 3:

    # Input: s = "pwwkew"
    # Output: 3
    # Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    # Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
# Find All Anagrams in a String
 
# Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
# Output: [0,6]
# Explanation:
# The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
# The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
# Output: [0,1,2]
# Explanation:
# The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
# The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
# The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104
# s and p consist of lowercase English letters.

# Minimum Window Substring
#Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

# The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
# Output: "BANC"
# Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "a", t = "a"
# Output: "a"
# Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
# Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
